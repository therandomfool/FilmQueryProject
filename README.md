## OBJECTIVES
## THE STORY OF HOW BABY STEPS ON NIBBLE AND NIBBLE ISNT HAPPY

- You will create a command-line application that retrieves and displays film data. It will be menu-based, allowing the user to choose actions and submit query data.

- All JDBC code will be encapsulated in methods of the com.skilldistillery.filmquery.database.DatabaseAccessorObject class. - - As you need new database access methods, declare them first in the DatabaseAccessor interface, then implement them in DatabaseAccessorObject. 
- Methods should return objects like Film, Actor, and List<Actor>, not String or List<String>.

- All user input and display output will be in methods of com.skilldistillery.filmquery.app.FilmQueryApp (or additional application classes in that package, if you choose to create them.) Comment out app.test(); and uncomment app.launch() as a starting point.

## User Stories

- User Story 1
- The user is presented with a menu in which they can choose to:

- Look up a film by its id.

- Look up a film by a search keyword.

- Exit the application.


- User Story 2

- If the user looks up a film by id, they are prompted to enter the film id. If the film is not found, they see a message saying so. If the film is found, its title, year, rating, and description are displayed.

- User Story 3

- If the user looks up a film by search keyword, they are prompted to enter it. If no matching films are found, they see a message saying so. Otherwise, they see a list of films for which the search term was found anywhere in the title or description, with each film displayed exactly as it is for User Story 2.

- User Story 4

- When a film is displayed, its language (English,Japanese, etc.) is also displayed.

- User Story 5

- When a film is displayed, the list of actors in its cast is displayed along with the title, year, rating, and description.User Stories
